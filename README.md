# etch-a-sketch
In this project, I created a pretty neat toy to practice DOM manipulation skills. It is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

# Things I learned
- Using CSS flexbox to create a X by X grid 
- The hover pseudo-class
- Toggling a feature on/off
- Creating the square divs using JS instead of copy pasting HTML
- Adding listeners to buttons

It's a tough assignment but that's okay because I am tough.
